## ⚠️ Difficulties Faced


- **Adding Motions**: Implementing animations using Framer Motion was challenging at first. Achieving the right timing and fluidity required some trial and error, but it taught me valuable lessons on how to enhance user experience through motion.
- **3D Scene Setup**: Working with 3D scenes in React Three Fiber was a whole new challenge for me. Positioning elements, fine-tuning lighting, and syncing everything with the UI was tricky at the start, but I improved with hands-on practice.
- **First Time with Tailwind CSS**: As someone new to Tailwind, I encountered a slight learning curve with utility-first classes. However, I quickly grasped its concepts, found it very intuitive, and now appreciate how it simplifies the styling process.
